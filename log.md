### Day 2: September 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Working on my Ravelry Hobby Project

**Thoughts** I've got a very basic test page up, theoretically if I can get the fetch request to work it would have a element to display in. I'm getting a CORS error, which I think means I need to set up some server stuff, but Fetch is making a request instead of just throwing errors!

### Day 3: September 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read about CORS, followed the MDN page on installing Express and its equivalent of "Hello, World!." Going to need to keep reading about Fetch API and using Express to get anything working, so nothing to push today.
