**Today's Progress**: I've solved 8 algorithm problems

**Thoughts** Working on Python algorithms that will be relevant to the interview process.

### Day 2: September 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Working on my Ravelry Hobby Project

**Thoughts** I've got a very basic test page up, theoretically if I can get the fetch request to work it would have a element to display in. I'm getting a CORS error, which I think means I need to set up some server stuff, but Fetch is making a request instead of just throwing errors!

### Day 3: September 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read about CORS, followed the MDN page on installing Express and its equivalent of "Hello, World!." Going to need to keep reading about Fetch API and using Express to get anything working, so nothing to push today.

### Day 4: September 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got a JSON back from Ravelry using a Python script. I don't think it'll be useful for the final product - setting up a way to get the data from Python to Javascript looks like a project in and of itself. I'll probably go back to trying to figure out Fetch and OAuth2, but at least now I can see what kind of JSON I get from Ravelry, and think about how I'll use it.
